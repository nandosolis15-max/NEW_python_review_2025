"""
Mini Calculator Challenge â€” f-strings + input + math
"""

print("Welcome to the Mini Calculator!\n")
# Get two numbers from the user
a = float(input("Enter first number: "))
b = float(input("Enter second number: "))

# Perform calculations and display results
# what you will do here is to calculate the sum, difference, product, quotient, and power of the two numbers
# Then print the results using f-strings

# for example:
sum_result = a + b
print(f"The sum of {a} and {b} is {sum_result}")

# Your code goes here
# Calculate difference

# Calculate product


# Calculate quotient


# Calculate power (a raised to the power of b)


# Print all results using f-strings
# for example:
# print(f"The difference of {a} and {b} is {difference_result}")
