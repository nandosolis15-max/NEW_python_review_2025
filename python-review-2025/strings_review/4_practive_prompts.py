# Find 3 objects around the room and create variables from it,
# Insert those variables into an f-string sentence(look at slide 22)in repl.it
x = "mouse"
y = "Keyboard"
z = "poster"
print(f"We are using a {y} and {x} to code. There is a {z} on the walls of the room")

# Familiarize yourself with the syntax of the print() function.

#syntax is the way we write code
# print("Hello World")
# name = "John"
#in other languages, this is different
# in javascript for example, you define
#variables with let or const or var
#in python, you just give your variables a
#name and then define it with a value


#challenge
# find a summary of the movie blue beetle online and create a 
# variable called blue_beetle_summary and print it it out to the screen
blue_beetle_summary = "Jaime Reyes suddenly finds himself in possession of an ancient relic of alien biotechnology called the Scarab. When the Scarab chooses Jaime to be its symbiotic host, he's bestowed with an incredible suit of armor that's capable of extraordinary and unpredictable powers, forever changing his destiny as he becomes the superhero Blue Beetle."
# print the length of the summary
print(len(blue_beetle_summary))
# upper case the entire summary
print(blue_beetle_summary.upper())
# print the summary
print(blue_beetle_summary)
# print the summary in lowercase
print(blue_beetle_summary.lower())
# replace the word blue with red
print(str.replace(blue_))
# print the summary
# string index the word beetle and print it out
# print the last word of the summary
# print the summary in reverse
